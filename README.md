# FSM Designer (Desktop Version)

This is a **desktop version** of the original [FSM Designer](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/) by [Evan Wallace](http://madebyevan.com/), repackaged using Electron to work fully offline on Windows.

> âœ¨ All credit for the original functionality, design, and interface goes to Evan Wallace.  
> ðŸ›  I have only adapted it into an installable desktop app for ease of use.
